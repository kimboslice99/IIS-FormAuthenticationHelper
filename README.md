# IIS-FormsAuthenticationHelper
- I built this module so FormsAuthentication can be used with pretty much any language, even a simple html only form that posts two fields `username` and `password`
- I also have an [Odbc provider](https://github.com/kimboslice99/OdbcProvider), which can be used with mysql or mariadb

This makes IIS a good substitute for Apache's form authentication, and integrates right into IIS's control panel :smiley:
